-- Slightly more complex example for a refined assignment
x :: liquid :: {v: Int | v > 0}
y :: liquid :: {v: Int | v > 5}

let x := 10 in {
    -- This works because we know a more specific type for x
    -- Due to the earlier assignment, the type of x is now {v: Int | v == 10}
    let y := x in {
        y
    }
}

-- Create a new let binding for x where it is 3
let x := 3 in {
    -- This should now fail, since 3 is not greater than 5
    let y := x in {
        y
    }
}
