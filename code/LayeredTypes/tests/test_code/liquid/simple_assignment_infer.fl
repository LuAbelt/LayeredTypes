-- Slightly more complex example for a refined assignment
x :: liquid :: {v: Int | v > 0}
y :: liquid :: {v: Int | v > 5}

x := 10
-- We (statically) know that the type of x is {v: Int | v == 10}
-- Should we accept this assignment?
y := x


-- Later reassignment should be accepted as well, if it matches the (original) defined type of x
x := 3

--Now the assignment to y should fail, since the type of x is {v: Int | v == 3}
-- which is not a subtype of {v: Int | v > 5}
y := x
